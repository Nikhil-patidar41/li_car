Overview
This machine learning model predicts car prices based on various features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and brand. The model was built using Streamlit for easy deployment and interaction.

Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
Feature Selection – Identifies the most influential factors affecting car prices.
Model Training – Uses Linear Regression and other ML models to improve accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics – Assesses performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.
Deployment Ready – Integrated with Streamlit for an interactive web-based prediction system.

Contents:
Data Cleaning & Exploration – Prepares the dataset for training.
Feature Engineering – Converts raw data into a machine-learning-friendly format.
Model Training & Testing – Implements and compares multiple models.
Predictions & Optimization – Fine-tunes hyperparameters for better accuracy.
web App Integration – Deploys the model using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
